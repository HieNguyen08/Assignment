# Stock Browser - Android App

**DISCLAIMER**: Work in progress

This project demonstrates how to write a modern android app in 2023. The main goal was to make the app robust, testable, and maintainable using minimal set of well-known libraries and following best practices.

The app itself is very simple. It loads market data from multiple 3rd party APIs and stores them in a local database. Then it allows users to search, browse and mark favorite items.

## Architecture

Architecture follows principles of separation of concerns. App is divided into 3 main layers, every one with its own responsibilities.

- **UI Layer** displays application data on screen using Jetpack Compose. It also holds state of simple components as text fields or  
- **Domain Layer** is responsible for encapsulating complex business logic, or simple business logic that is reused by multiple ViewModels.
- **Data Layer** contains application data and business logic

TODO: write more about architecture
